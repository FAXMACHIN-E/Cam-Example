## Project Basics

Background about American Sign Language (ASL): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language

The purpose of this project is to help deaf & mute people to communicate using ASL with those who doesn't know ASL. While we can ask deaf & mute people to learn typing but it'd be greatly useful if they don't touch keyboards in the middle of a presentation going through slides or annotating on a whiteboard. 

By the end of the semester we aim to be able to intepret English alphabet (instead of the whole ASL vocabulary) as this is a 7-week semester.

We'll provide web interface for users to upload or connect with the PC's camera. For each of the frames in the video, we intepret the American Sign Language gesture into an English letter. The history of the English letters of the video will be shown in the web page as the scripts. Users will need to have their own login to use the web interface and scripts in the past will be saved for each account. We can also show the user the words with top frequecy. It will look something like in the below link but we'll try to make it more user interactive: https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/american-sign-language-letters

We plan to use the database to store information per account and use flask framework for the web interface.


## Project Structure (to be updated as evolving)

/app/ - The folder containing the app.
/app/app.py - The main app entry point
/app/templates - Where the templates live.

/app/static - Static files, etc.

/framework/ - ???.

The main components of the app are:

1. **Input** - This component is about module to handle input - image/video uploaded by users, or content from web camera stream directly. It will also check compatibility - whether the input is the right type within the proper size range. 

2. **Processing** - This module contains tailored machine learning model to process reveived input and generate output, the processing time should be reasonable to achieve desired user experience. 

3. **Output** - This component is to show the output - letters in scripts (or edited video, to be investigated and confirmed) in desired format. 

4. **Database**(optional) - This component stores information per user account, user ID & password, logging, uploaded files, etc. 

5. **Security** (to be investigated and confirmed) - This part contains user registration, authentication, etc. E.g., users need to provide valid email addresses for registration, and validation is needed if users want to upload files in the website.

6. **Visualization** (to be confirmed later)- This part is to describe models in a visual way, and illustrate key user activities in the webside (frequency, etc.)
